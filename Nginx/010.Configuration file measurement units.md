# Configuration file measurement units

Sizes can be specified in bytes, kilobytes (suffixes k and K) or megabytes (suffixes m and M), for example, “`1024`”, “`8k`”, “`1m`”.

Offsets may be also specified in gigabytes using g or G suffixes.

Time intervals can be specified in milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours, days and so on, using the following suffixes:

ms	milliseconds
s	seconds
m	minutes
h	hours
d	days
w	weeks
M	months, 30 days
y	years, 365 days
Multiple units can be combined in a single value by specifying them in the order from the most to the least significant, and optionally separated by whitespace. For example, “`1h 30m`” specifies the same time as “`90m`” or “`5400s`”. A value without a suffix means seconds. It is recommended to always specify a suffix.

Some of the time intervals can be specified only with a seconds resolution.
